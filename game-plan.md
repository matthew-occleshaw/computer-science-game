[TOC]

## Instructions

- Create a game (could be text or graphics based) which has the following:
- A character which you are able to move between rooms
- This character has the following attributes:
  - Health
  - Speed
  - Attack
- A backpack which can store up to 3 items (there has to be a mechanism to check - whether it is full before you pick another item up)
- These rooms are linked to each other
- These rooms can contain:
  - Enemies
  - Locked Doors which require a key
  - Items that can help the adventurer along their quest (improve their attributes/keys)
  - Have a clear end circumstance which results in a win/lose
