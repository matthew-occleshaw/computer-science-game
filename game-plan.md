# Game Plan

[Repl.it Code](https://repl.it/@ConspiracyTheor/Computer-Science-Game "repl.it")  

[TOC]

## Instructions

- Create a game (could be text or graphics based) which has the following:
- A character which you are able to move between rooms
- This character has the following attributes:
	- Health
	- Speed
	- Attack
- And a backpack which can store up to 3 items (there has to be a mechanism to check -  whether it is full before you pick another item up)
- These rooms are linked to each other
- These rooms can contain:
	- Enemies
	- Locked Doors which require a key
	- Items that can help the adventurer along their quest (improve their attributes/keys)
	- Have a clear end circumstance which results in win/lose

## To Do

- [ ] Allow swapping of items when backpack full
- [ ] Make top down module diagram of program flow
- [ ] Write out what I want the actual output to look like
